# Valdese Lakeside Park App

This is a web application intended to help explore current and future features
of the Lakeside Park in Valdese, NC. It illustrates several Primary Trails as
they currently exist, adventure trails via a zakklab extension, and the future
park plan as it was documented in the park origin plans.

## Survey Data

Marks are documented as Heading and Distance. Headings are expressed using
degrees, arcminutes and arcseconds. Arcminutes and arcseconds are expressed
using the prime (′) and double-prime (″) characters, respectively, although
a single-quote and double-quote are often used for convenience. One arcminute
is equal to 1/60th of a degree, and one arcsecond is equal to 1/60th of an
arcminute:

Decimal_Degrees = D + arcmin/60 + arcsec/3600
