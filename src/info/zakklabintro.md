<summary>Rhododendron Row</summary>

- Unrecommended Trail
- 0.15 Miles

A wooded trail running from Red to Green past the Picnic Tables.
The trail is wide but at the Green side there is a 20ft bank you have to climb down with trees and for that reason isn't recommended.
There are great views on the trail like a Row of Rhododendrons along the path and if you adventure off the side you can see great water views.

**Can't find this trail on the map?** Because of the steep bank you have to climb down, the trail is off by default. You can turn in on in the upper right hand corner menu by checking the box.

**This trail may be re-routed in the future**
