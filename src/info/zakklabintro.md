<summary>Rhododendron Row</summary>

- Unrecommended Trail
- 0.15 Miles

A wooded trail running from Red to Green past the Picnic Tables.
The trail is wide but at the Green side there is a 20ft bank you have to climb down with trees and for that reason isn't recommended.
There are great views on the trail like a Row of Rhododendrons along the path and if you adventure off the side you can see great water views.
