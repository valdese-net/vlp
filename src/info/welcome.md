# Welcome to Valdese Lakeside Park

Welcome to **Valdese Lakeside Park** - a 300 acre park with construction set
to start in 2020. 

Below are some things you should know about the Interactive App:

You can install the app on any device. Detailed Instructions can be found <a href="http://friendsofthevaldeserec.org/" target="_blank">here.</a> But here is a quick overview:

On iOS: In Safari, Tap the share button (the middle button on the bottom) and scroll down until you find "Add to Homescreen"

On Android: In Chrome, Tap the bottom prompt that says "Add to Homescreen"

You can track your location in the app by tapping the hiking man icon in the app and your location will be shown on screen.

The menu in the top right corner will open a menu that allows you to change what trails you can see on the map, toggle different markers on and off, as well as changing the map view (between Terrain Lines, A satellite view, and the Future Park Plan)

The icons you see on screen are clickable and will tell you about that location.

The (i) icon in the top left corner provides more information about the park and summaries of all the trails here.

And lastly enjoy your trip to Valdese Lakeside Park!
