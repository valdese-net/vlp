history:
- [1601845555, "Major Changes: New Outer Creek and Hoyle Creek Trail are in the works. Stay straight at the Outer Creek switchback to see the future Outer Creek Trail (in progress). The Hoyle Creek trail closer to Hoyle Creek is almost finished. Shade Seeker now includes Shade Cut and is a sea-foam green. Outer Creek Trail (no more Outer Creek Connector) uses Oven and previous Hoyle Creek as a part of it along with new Logging Roads found past the switchback and atv trails to the left by Weaver Creek to form a 1.3 mile trail. Connector Trails are marked in a dashed dark gray/purple color and can be used to decrease length of other trails (shortcuts). Pink Trail is now named Quez and is dark pink/red. Stone Skipper is now pink. Re-ordered Points of Interest and Trails in the Layer Menu. Finished Global Navigation in the top left corner. Added Benches along Hoyle Creek on map. (Thanks Peter Skelton). Creeks are now on the map (Goode's Creek along Yellow), (Weaver Creek along Outer Creek), along with others off of Hoyle Creek, the Power Lines, etc). These were added as a map change independent of the app and may not have appeared yet for you. (Submitted creeks 3 days ago). Please note that Hoyle Creek and Outer Creek are not yet finished/finalized."]

- [1598048500, "New Trail: Nicknamed the Shade Cut (subject to change) the trail runs from the Hoyle Creek Beaver Dam up onto Shade Seaker. Description: Wide, Gentle-Moderate Slope, .28 miles. A large tree is down across the trail and some things may need clipping but should be clear in a few days."]
- [1597532000, "Additional Icons along Hoyle Creek"]
- [1596323605, "New tools: A more simple measurement widget that is more mobile-friendly. In the bottom right corner there is an upload and download button. You can download where you've walked with the app open (can't have your phone asleep) to then send to other people or view later. The upload button will allow you to select a gpx, json, or geojson file (a mapping file/what the download button gives you) and it will plot the route on your map."]

- [1594574133, "Visual Changes: Blue Loop, Shade Seeker, Outer Creek, Oven, McGalliard Falls Greenway are now solid-line trails. Simplified the meaning of some elements in the app: Dashed Line Trails mean a connector that is often steep or in the case of the High School Trails, off Park Property."]
