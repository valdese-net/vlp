Founded in April 2015, the [Friends of the Valdese Rec][link-fvr] is an all-volunteer, 501(c)(3)
tax-exempt nonprofit corporation. Our mission is to support the Valdese Parks and
Recreation Department with volunteer hours and fundraising for the betterment of the
Department, while at the same time benefiting the town, the citizens and the environment.

## History

The driving force in starting Friends of the Valdese Rec was to acquire 300 acres of land at
Lake Rhodhiss between the Wastewater Plant and McGalliard Falls and construct a park with
trails, kayak launch, disc golf, playground and picnic areas. The Town of Valdese successfully
closed on the property at the end of January 2018, with a Ribbon Cutting ceremony from within
the park in March.
