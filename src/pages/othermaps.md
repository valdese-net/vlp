# Alternative Maps

In addition to the base map featuring the main trails and icons, there are also additional maps with more tools, trails, future features, and more.

Here are some of them:
- [Map of Burke County for looking around the park's surrounding area][link-mapburke] 
- [Map with Measuring Tool for measuring path distances on the map][link-mapmeasure] 
- [Trail Expansions (includes Tim Johnson's mountain bike expansion, Friends of the Valdese Rec trail expansions, or existing unmaintained logging roads)][link-everything]
- [Volunteer Maintenance Map (with descriptions of job, tools needed, etc)][link-volunteer]

[link-everything]: everything.map
[link-mapburke]: mapburke.map
[link-mapmeasure]: mapmeasure.map
[link-volunteer]: volunteer.map
