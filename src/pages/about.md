# About the Park

{% include 'pages/social.html' %}

The [Friends of the Valdese Rec][link-fvr] would like to welcome you to Valdese Lakeside,
a 325 acre municipal park. We hope that enjoy your visit to Valdese Lakeside Park!
This park would not exist without funding from grants and community donations, plus all the volunteer hours.

- **Nov 2021** - Phase 1 Complete celebration was held for 4000 linear ft of greenway, restrooms, wildlife viewing platform, parking and entry road.
- **May 2022** – Dog Park opened
- **July 2022** – A 160-foot bridge over McGalliard Creek to complete the 2-mile greenway from Valdese Lakeside Park to McGalliard Falls Park opened.
- **April 2023** – The 2-mile greenway from Valdese Lakeside Park to McGalliard Falls Park was completed with crushed cinder paving.
- **July 2023** – The kayak launch and fishing pier opened.

**Planning to go out on the water?** Duke Energy manages the water level and [publishes
information about this][link-lakelevels]. We recommend putting in at the Table Rock
Viewing Site less than 0.1 miles down the Greenway.

**Want to see all the wildlife found at the park?** The park is home to a variety of
species. A generous sampling of the park wildlife can be seen on [the zakklab site][link-zakklab].
