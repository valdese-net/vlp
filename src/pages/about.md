# About the Park

{% include 'pages/social.html' %}

The [Friends of the Valdese Rec][link-fvr] would like to welcome you to Valdese Lakeside,
a 325 acre municipal park ith ongoing construction set to be completed by November 30th. Currently, the park is
maintained by the [Friends of the Valdese Rec][link-fvr] volunteer organization.
We hope that enjoy your visit to Valdese Lakeside Park!

The [Friends of the Valdese Rec][link-fvr] is [currently accepting donations][link-bridgedonate] for construction
of a **150 foot suspension bridge** connecting McGalliard Falls and Valdese Lakeside Park. Donations are accepted
through Facebook, Paypal, Mail, or a Stock donation.

**Planning to go out on the water?** Duke Energy manages the water level and [publishes
information about this][link-lakelevels]. We recommend putting in at the Table Rock
Viewing Site less than 0.1 miles down the Greenway.

**Want to see all the wildlife found at the park?** The park is home to a variety of
species. A generous sampling of the park wildlife can be seen on [the zakklab site][link-zakklab].
