	[1594219389, "zakklab: New Trail Discovered: Now part of the Lime Loop and connects up to Red. Some branches and plants are in the way but is easily walkable. When looking at the map, the far left trail is .28 miles, the middle is .25, and the new one is .22 if you go Red-Green. Oven Trail is now a dark red/pink color due to color duplication from High School trails and now Black Dot. Bikes are currently being discouraged on the Hoyle Creek trail because of various factors. The trail is growing in popularity and the narrow nature of it does not support the high traffic with fast moving bikes. The bikes have been causing mud to accumulate on the trail and making it less harder to walk. Turtles also often lay on the trail and could be hurt. Opinions are welcome."],
